The offical page of Latex is(google says so):
```
https://www.latex-project.org/
```

Now I am trying this in MACOS:
```
http://www.tug.org/mactex/
```

download the mactex file and install it.

Just immediately after installing mactex you need to start `TexLive`
Texlive is basically an update manager for latex. It will update your latex verion(which seems like consists of a lot of things)

Now lest see what this `texshop` is.

##creating your first pdf using latex:

Lets write these in the texshop window:
```
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
hello world!!!!
tlooking great so far
% all kind of comments
\end{document}
```

Now press `Typeset` button it might ask first for saving if this is a new file. After that you will see the pdf view :D
